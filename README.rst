A collection of short utility functions that I find useful.  Some I've
written myself and some I've scrounged from the web.  Full source code
is maintained at `github.com/Timothy-W-Hilton/TimPyUtils
<https://github.com/Timothy-W-Hilton/TimPyUtils>`_

Version 1.0 substantially improves docstrings throughout the project.

Please also see `the full documenation <http://timpyutils.readthedocs.org/>`_.
